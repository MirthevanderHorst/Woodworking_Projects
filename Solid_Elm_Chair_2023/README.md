# Solid Elm wooden chair

Itâ€™s time to relax! Taking inspiration from both a wheelbarrow and the works of Gerrit Rietveld, I designed and built this chair!

What makes this chair interesting is its sitting comfort. The seat is fully shaped by hand and involved a lot of experimenting with the right angles, depths and heights. It may be solid wood, but feels way softer than a lot of upholstered furniture!

Pretty much every single technique used in this project was new to me. I did not have the time or materials to try things out beforehand, making it a very nice â€“ yet stressfull â€“ challenge.

This wooden chair is made exclusively with scrap pieces of solid elm and finished with Osmo hardwax oil. I made this piece as an intern - and on behalf of - stichting Tafelboom (Utrecht, NL)ðŸªµ 

It was also my last project ever (company-exam) as a Cibap student. For this chair I got the highest possible grade for every single exam component, something I am very proud of!
