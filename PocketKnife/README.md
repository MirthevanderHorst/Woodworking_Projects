# Pocket knife project - July 2024

Finally finished this knife! I started working on it around 4-5 years ago (I think 2019) and then forgot about it, letting it rot in the shed for a few years. (oops) 🐛🐛 Last week, I found it again and decided to finally sand and oil it. I am so happy with how it turned out!

This knife is made completely from scratch wood (Walnut and Wenge) and metal. The only tools I used for this project were an old hand saw, a file, and some sandpaper, so it took a while to make. Maybe it’s time to invest in some proper woodworking tools; joining wood pieces without a bench plane or chisel can be a pain!

The metal of this knife is too soft to properly sharpen and use for anything other than butter, but I still think it turned out pretty cool. Maybe in the future, I will make another one with proper materials!😊
